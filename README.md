This is a collection of images generated two years ago with Stable Diffusion 1.2 locally using customized models heavily trained on various sci-fi sources and a set of simple images as initial graphics for generating variations and permutations of them using Python, and thousands of generation cycles. This particular set is free to download, use, recycle and process it further in any way, for example as a baseline for a custom made card game. Soon, I will process it through few AI engines, and maybe they will come up with and abstract, fully AI-directed game system with fynctions for these cards. Feel free to use them as long, as it's not commercial.  Adittionally in this folder there is a PDF file explaining some of the functions of the Arcanas, as well as delivering quite an interesting modern take on Tarot from the perspective of AI.
